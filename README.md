# What did I do?

> ***Why did I make it?***
> *To help my new co-workers or it maybe also help you. I realize that my new co-workers often get troubles when they started working with ADF Faces and EJB in their probationary period. In my company, a new member often get two months for probationary period, they must learn the ADF Faces and EJB technology and then try making a demo project to show their understanding. The problems often happen when they embark on the demo project. They really got confused because nobody tell them, how shoud they start doing that? It's a primary reason that made me do this. I have tried to build a template project that include all of thing what they need, such as Dependency Injection, a home page template with menu bar, support multilanguage, some UI components they need to know, boostrap, etc.*


### Dependency Injection
______
- ***Concepts***
    - As far as I know, Dependency Injection is a common technique that was supported by lots of Frameworks nowadays. Right? I guess.
Yep, when I started working in the new company, started working with ADF Faces, EJB. I really felt a little bit upset cause ADF Faces doesn't support full injection. It means **you can't inject a SessionBean into a ManagedBean**. Someone will tell that isn't necessary. I also agree, but most the time, you need to declare a remote context or a local context before looking up a SessionBean from Weblogic.
 
   - It's quite backward and I'm too lazy to do that. It's better for me if someone can automatically look up it for me like Spring do with annotation @Autowired. If you also lazy like me, you can use this solution. Even it doesn't work at all, but I think the idea is really good. Read [here](http://codeplay.net/2010/09/14/inject-ejb-to-adf-managed-bean/). I have modified something to make it better.
